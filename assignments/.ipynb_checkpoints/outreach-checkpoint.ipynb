    "There is an exchange between two suspects at a motorway junction outside Heathrow Airport at 09:00 tomorrow morning.  During this meeting, they will be transferring two parts of a secret weapon thing.  The transfer is secured by biometric technology, so we need the transfer to be made and apprehend the two together.  They are suspicious, and if they have any indication that we are watching them, the transfer will be cancelled.\n",

    "Our top operative lives in Southampton.  We need them to arrive at this junction as close as possible to the time of the transfer so as not to arouse suspicion.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're the best data scientist in the organisation.  We need you to calculate what time they should leave.  Take account of variability of traffic volume.  It is better to be slightly late rather than slightly early, since we can still gain valuable intelligence from them as long as no suspicion is aroused.\n",
