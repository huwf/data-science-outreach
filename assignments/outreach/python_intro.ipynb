There are a few special words which you cannot call a variable, such as `class`, otherwise most combinations of letters, numbers and underscores can be used.  Variables are case sensitive.  \n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There we have an example of different types of variables: integers and a string.  The string is surrounded by either `''` or `\"\"`, and can be any combination of numbers and letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are just defined as they are.  The same can be said for the `float` type, which is any real number, though very large numbers are restricted.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used booleans, which are simple True/False values.  Boolean statements are known as conditionals, and are used to decide whether to run certain blocks of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we are using the `print` function to output the value to the screen.  All the values we want to output are separated by the commas within parentheses.  These are called parameters, and will be used within the function.  Like a mathematical function, as these values change, so too does the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` function is a part of Python, but we can also write our own functions.  This makes it possible to logically order our code better, and to only have to write how to do a particular task once.  A function which I wrote to help for this exercise is called `get_csv`, which gets the data for the exercise which is stored in a csv file.  The parameters the function takes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `group_no` What number group you are.  If you are just doing on your own, pick a number between 1 and 7.\n",
    "- `year` The year as a 4 digit number, between 2012 and 2015\n",
    "- `month` The month as an integer between 1 and 12\n",
    "- `amount_of_lines` The amount of lines of the CSV file to return\n",
    "- `show_headers` Whether to show the headers of the CSV columns.  Default value: `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aside: What is a CSV File?\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV stands for \"comma-separated values\", and is a simple file format which holds data as a series of rows which are separated by commas.  It can be opened by Microsoft Excel but is easier to use for programming because it's just plain text and not a proprietary format."

    "Each new \"block\" of code MUST be indented by the same amount of spaces.  An important example of this is where we use an `if` statement to decide whether to run the next bit of code.  If statements evaluate the result of a boolean variable (`True` or `False`).\n",
