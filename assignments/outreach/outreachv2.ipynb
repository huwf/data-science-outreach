    "There is an exchange between two suspects at a motorway junction outside Heathrow Airport at 09:00 tomorrow morning. During this meeting, they will be transferring two parts of a secret weapon device. The transfer is secured by biometric technology, so we need the transfer to be made and apprehend the two parts together. The suspects are suspicious, and if they have any indication that we are watching them, the transfer will be aborted.\n",

    "Weâ€™ve heard that you're the best upcoming talent in the leading data science department in Southampton. We need you to calculate what time they should leave. Take account of variability of traffic volume. It is better to be slightly late rather than slightly early, since we can still gain valuable intelligence from them as long as no suspicion is aroused.\n",
